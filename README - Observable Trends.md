# pandas-challenge

In this assignment I conducted a thorough analysis of a school district's data using Pandas (JupyterLab).

Through conducting this analysis I was able to make some of observations about trends in the data.

Firstly, my analysis grouping school results based on average school spending per student yielded surprising results.
The schools which had less school spending actually had the strongest results. In my bottom spending range (<$585), there was a 90.64% overall pass rate.
This is in stark to the highest spending range ($640-675), where there was only a 53.67% overall passing rate.

Secondly, my analysis of the results of different school types in the district, showed that charter schools at a far greater pass rate.
The overall pass rate at charter school's was 90.56%, a vast contrast to the district schools overall pass rate of just 53.70%.
